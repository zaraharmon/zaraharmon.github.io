I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics (MPI)](https://www.mpi.nl/). I joined the MPI [Language Development Department](https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-development/3) in October 2023. I work with [Caroline Rowland](https://www.mpi.nl/people/rowland-caroline) on [the Language 0-5 project](https://www.lucid.ac.uk/what-we-do/research/lucid-phase-1-completed-projects-2014-2019/language-0-5-project/), investigating the development of hierarchical structure and complex planning. I am particularly interested in how prediction, planning, and overgeneralization errors during development help children build representations that organize sequences of words.

I received my PhD from the [University of Oregon Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.uoregon.edu) in 2019 under the supervision of [Volya Kapatsinski](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/ublab/whoiswho/). My dissertation is about "Accessibility-driven Language Production" and its effect on language use through semantic extension [[pdf]](https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1794/24946/Harmon_oregon_0171A_12546.pdf). After completing my PhD, I joined the [University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu) and worked in [Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/)'s lab, modeling morphological learning in typically developing children and children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). At UMD, I was also a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) and a postdoc affiliate at the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.umd.edu) and the program in [Neuroscience and Cognitive Science (NACS)](https://nacs.umd.edu). Following my postdoc at UMD, I briefly joined the Univeristy of Iowa DLD Longitudinal Study team at the Department of Communiucation Sciences and Disorders to study processing difficulties in adults with DLD. I helped with designing and implementing eye-tracking studies to investigate individual differences in processing at both the word and sentence levels and in both comprehension and production. These studies are currently ongoing. 

My research explores how speakers extend familiar forms to novel contexts, and factors that influence the ease or difficulty of this process. More specifically, I study how form-based cues and top-down cues influence generalization and productivity, how reliance on these cues help with hierarchical and sequential planning, and how these cues interact during learning and development. See my [publications](https://zaraharmon.github.io/Publications/) page for more information. 

## Areas of Interest
<blockquote style="border: 2px solid #F8F5F5; padding: 10px; background-color: #F8F5F5;"> 
<li> Automaticity, sequential learning, and chunking in language

<!--University of Maryland UMIACS and the Department of Linguistics to work with [Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/) and [Jan Edwards](https://learningtotalk.umd.edu) on a computational modeling project on Developmental Language Disorder. The goal of the project is to model morphological productivity in the speech of children with Developmental Language Disorder and inform interevention efforts.-->
