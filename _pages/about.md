I received my PhD from the University of Oregon in 2019. My research explores how speakers extend familiar forms to novel contexts, and factors that influence the ease or difficulty of this process. More specifically, I study how contextual cues and top-down cues influence generalization and productivity, and how these cues interact during learning. At UMD, I work with Naomi Feldman and Jan Edwards. I am using probabilistic models to investigate problems with productivity of grammatical morphemes in the speech of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD).
