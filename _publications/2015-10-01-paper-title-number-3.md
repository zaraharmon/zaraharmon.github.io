excerpt: '<blockquote style="border: 2px solid #F8F5F5; padding: 10px; background-color: #F8F5F5;"> Repetitions are ubiquitous in all domains that involve producing an action sequence, and occur when the upcoming plan is not activated enough to be executed. Repetitions are helpful in this situation because the repeated action sequence activates the likely continuation. In this work, we propose a theory of repetition and retreival in the form of three hypotheses: The faciliation hypothesis, the reactivation hypothesis, and the initiation hypothesis. 
<br>
<br>   <b>Highlights</b>
<br>  &nbsp; - The Facilitation Hypothesis maintains that repetitions facilitate accessing the upcoming item. 
<br>  &nbsp; - The Reactivation Hypothesis claims that previously produced words must be reactivated to be re-produced, and that this reactivation process uses the words that follow as cues. 
<br>  &nbsp; - The Initiation Hypothesis claims that, after an interruption, speech is restarted from words that have occurred relatively unexpectedly in the speaker’s prior experi- ence. The Initiation Hypothesis attributes this effect to Cue Competition between preceding context and top-down cues: initiation from words that tend to occur in predictive preceding-word contexts is relatively unlikely because such words have a weaker association with top-down cues.</blockquote>'

Repetition appears to be part of error correction and action preparation in all domains that involve producing an action sequence. The present work contends that the ubiquity of repetition is due to its role in resolving a problem inherent to planning and retrieval of action sequences: the Problem of Retrieval. Repetitions occur when the production to perform next is not activated enough to be executed. Repetitions are helpful in this situation because the repeated action sequence activates the likely continuation. We model a corpus of natural speech using a recurrent network, with words as units of production. We show that repeated material makes upcoming words more predictable, especially when more than one word is repeated. Speakers are argued to produce multiword repetitions by using backward associations to reactivate recently produced words. The existence of multiword repetitions means that speakers must decide where to reinitiate execution from. We show that production restarts from words that have seldom occurred in a predictive preceding-word context and have often occurred utterance-initially. These results are explained by competition between preceding-context and top-down cues over the course of language learning.
