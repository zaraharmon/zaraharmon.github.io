excerpt: '<blockquote style="border: 2px solid #F8F5F5; padding: 10px; background-color: #F8F5F5;"> Feedback has been shown to be effective in shifting attention across perceptual cues to a phonological contrast in speech perception. However, the learning mechanisms behind this process remain obscure. In this work, we compare the predictions of supervised error-driven learning (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) and reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) about the effect of feedback on cue reweighting using computational simulations. 
<br>
<br>   <b>Highlights</b>
<br>  &nbsp; - Experimental data show that when given explicit error feedback, learners downweight a primary cue to a phonetic contrast, but only when they can use another cue to reduce prediction error.
<br>  &nbsp; - Simulations of experimental data implicate reinforcement learning as the mechanism behind the effect of feedback on cue weighting in speech perception.

Feedback has been shown to be effective in shifting attention across perceptual cues to a phonological contrast in speech perception. However, the learning mechanisms behind this process remain obscure. We compare the predictions of supervised error-driven learning (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) and reinforcement learning (Sutton & Barto, 1998) using computational simulations. Supervised learning predicts downweighting of an informative cue when the learner receives evidence that it is no longer informative. In contrast, reinforcement learning suggests that a reduction in cue weight requires positive evidence for the informativeness of an alternative cue. Experimental evidence supports the latter prediction, implicating reinforcement learning as the mechanism behind the effect of feedback on cue weighting in speech perception.
