title: "The Competition–Compensation Account of Developmental Language Disorder"

excerpt: 'Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) regularly use the base form of verbs (e.g.,
dance) instead of inflected forms (e.g., danced). We propose an account of this behavior in which
processing difficulties of children with DLD disproportionally affect processing novel inflected
verbs in their input. This leads the inflected form to face stronger competition from alternatives,
reducing its productivity. Competition is resolved through a compensatory behavior which
involves producing a more accessible alternative with high phonological and semantic overlap
with the inflected form: in English, the bare form. Using a nonparametric Bayesian model, we
show that the reduction in the number of novel inflected forms in the input of the DLD model
leads to additional opportunities for processing verbs as unanalyzed chunks and fewer
opportunities to parse the inflected from independently of co-occurring stems. We further show
that such a bias in a model with impaired processing could exaggerate difficulties with productive
use of inflectional suffixes. Together, the results suggest that inconsistent use of inflectional
morphemes by children with DLD could stem from a combination of processing difficulties that affect novelty detection combined with a resulting learned bias to rely on unanalyzed chunks during processing.'
